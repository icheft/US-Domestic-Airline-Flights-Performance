# US Domestic Airline Flights Performance Dashboard

This repository contains only the beautified version of the final assignment found on IBM's [Data Visualization with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-for-data-visualization) held on Coursera. The ideas, contents and, resources are not owned particularly by me. Since the coursework is changing continuously, what works today may not be exactly what you need tomorrow; therefore, please use this repository wisely.

With that said, you can still play along with [the live demo](https://us-dafp.herokuapp.com/) served on Heroku. Please be advised that sometimes the server may take sometime to restart as I am not purchasing any plans.
